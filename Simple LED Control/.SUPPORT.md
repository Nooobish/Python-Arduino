# Requiremenst
  - Arduino board
  - USB Cable
  - Breedboard
  - LED 
  - 220Î© Resistor
  - Wires
  
**For each LED you need one resistor (1 LED = 1 Resistor)**

# How to connect
![Scheme_1_Led_Connect.png](./img/Scheme_1_Led_Connect.png)
>LED has + and -, wrongly connected they will not work (longer leg is +, shorter leg is -)
>Resistors doesn't have + and -, no matter how you connect it results will be same
>Resistors can be puted before or after led
>For more LEDs just repeat same process, just connect it to 3 and so on

# First step first
I consider that you already installed driver and prepared your board
1. Download [ArduinoIDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) 
2. Select right port and board (Tools -> Board, Port)
3. Go to File -> Examples -> Firmata -> StandardFirmata -> Upload (Arrow)
4. Configure config.json file for your needs, the most important is to select right USB port
5. Run .py code
