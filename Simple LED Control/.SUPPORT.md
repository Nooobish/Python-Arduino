# Requiremenst
  - Arduino board
  - USB Cable
  - Breedboard
  - LED 
  - 220Î© Resistor
  - Wires
  
**For each LED you need one resistor (1 LED = 1 Resistor)**

# How to connect
This "scheme/image" can be used for any .py script in it's folder
If you have more leds, just do same process starting from pin 3

# Notes
 - LED has polarity ("+" and "-"), wrongly connected they will not work.
 - LED "+" has longer leg, LED "-" has shorter
 - Resistors doesn't have polarity ("+" or "-"), no matter how you connect them results will be same.
 
# Code Explanation
I will consider you know basic knowledge of Python so I will explain only few important lines:
```python
 import pyfirmata
```
[pyfirmata](https://pypi.org/project/pyFirmata/) is a Python interface for the Firmata protocol.
[Firmata](http://firmata.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a generic protocol for communicating with microcontrollers from software on a host computer.
In this scenario microcontroller is Arduino board.

```python
 board = pyfirmata.Arduino(str(config["port"]))
```
Defines the output port (select your Arduino).

```python
  board.digital[led].write(1)
  board.digital[led].write(0)
```
Arduino pins 2-13 (digital) has 2 states:
1. 0 = OFF = 0V
2. 1 = ON = 5V

Basicly what python does is "**PORT-X on digital port 2 change state from ON/OFF to ON/FF**"






# First step first
I consider that you already installed driver and prepared your board
1. Download [ArduinoIDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) 
2. Select right port and board (Tools -> Board, Port)
3. Go to File -> Examples -> Firmata -> StandardFirmata -> Upload (Arrow)
4. Configure config.json file for your needs, the most important is to select right USB port
5. Run .py code
