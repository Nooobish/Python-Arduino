# Python-Arduino
Python &amp; Arduino

# Short description
I will post small Python scripts made on my way to control Arduino Board. I hope you can use it, learn from it and even expend possibility and share with comunity.
Anything I make I will try to explain in detail (but keep it simple and short) and share my code.
If I don't explain something feel free and ask or use internet (I do same).

# Requirements
1. Arduino board and other electronics used for specific topic
2. Computer


If you like what I do, please show some love (watch repo) and I will continue updating it.
